        "New Delhi: Congress leader and Punjabi singer Sidhu Moose Wala was shot dead on Sunday, a day after his security was withdrawn by the state police. However, it is to be pondered upon, what made the Punjabi singing fame surrounded by controversies Born on 17 June 1993, Moosewala, whose real name is Shubhdeep Singh Sidhu, belongs to the Moosewala village which is situated in Punjab's Mansa district. Moose Wala enjoyed stardom only a few could imagine at a young age in the twenties of his life. He learned music during his college days and after completing his education, he moved to Canada.However, being widely known for his 'gangster rap', hit the headlines for all the wrong reasons.He was widely popular among the youth having 6.9 million followers on Instagram. However, his stardom was often overtaken by the controversies surrounding him for promoting drugs and violence through his songs.For instance, one of his songs titled 'Jatti Jeone Morh Wargi' came under the scanner as it made a reference to the 18th-century Sikh warrior Mai Bhago.Many FIRs were also registered against Moose Wala for promoting violence and hurting the religious sentiments of the Sikh community. However, he had issued an apology later on after people slammed him for portraying the Sikh warrior in a poor light.Moose Wala was booked after the pictures of him with an AK-47 went viral on social media during the COVID pandemic.Later, he was also booked by the Punjab police under the Arms Act after being charged with the promotion of gun culture in 2020. The action was taken for one of his songs Panj Goliyan",

        "It has recently come to light that Tom Hanks is an admirer of Aamir Khan as well. Aamir Khan happened to meet him somewhere in 2014 or 2015 when he flew down to Germany to have a meeting with acclaimed filmmaker Steven Spielberg. It so happened that Aamir Khan wished to remake Forrest Gump (1994) whose rights rested with its director Robert Zemeckis. Robert, however, refused to meet Aamir. Aamir tried a lot to set up the meeting but in vain. Left with no choice, he decided to meet Steven Spielberg, who was then shooting for his film Bridge Of Spies (2015). Interestingly, the film starred Tom Hanks, who also starred in Forrest Gump and whose role Aamir wanted to essay in the remake. Robert Zemeckis held Spielberg in high regard. As a result, Aamir felt that if Steven Spielberg would convince Robert, the latter would part with the remake rights of Forrest Gump. Aamir Khan reached the sets of Bridge Of Spies and met Steven Spielberg along with Tom Hanks. Steven Spielberg introduced Aamir to Tom Hanks as ‘James Cameron of India’. This is because according to the filmmaker, just like how James Cameron breaks his own box office records, so does Aamir! Tom Hanks, however, made it clear that he knows Aamir very well. He also admitted that he loved Aamir’s 2009 film 3 Idiots and that he has seen it as many as 3 times! Aamir Khan then told Steven Spielberg about his predicament about Robert Zemeckis. To which Spielberg told Aamir that his relationship with Zemeckis was like that of a father and a son. And like most fathers and sons, they don’t always get along well! He also revealed to Aamir that Robert Zemeckis was refusing to meet the superstar as he didn’t want to say ‘no’ to Aamir’s face. Nevertheless, Aamir Khan kept on trying. At last, he won the remake rights. The remake of Forrest Gump came to be known as Laal Singh Chaddha. It is all set to release on August 11, 2022, and is one of the most awaited films of the year.",

        "Talking to Bollywood Hungama about her past films, she said, “I was not happy. Sometimes you work against your wishes, just because you have to keep working. When the thought of out of sight is out of mind takes over, you don't have many choices. Today it is quite easy for me to sit and say that instead of doing those films I should have learned kung fu in China or anything else. Today it is easy for me to say that. But it wasn't the same 6-7 years ago. Back then I was just trying to understand myself and wondering what happened. My first film did well and everyone even appreciated it. But why weren't certain choices given to me after that? Then I get the answer that you should do the kind of films which have songs, and if the song is a hit, the film also works. But I didn't think that way. It worked for somebody, but may not work for me. But you still want to try because somebody is saying, either someone who is experienced or someone from your team. They come from a  place where they mean well to you.She further said, “Then you are told that only when you work with certain names, and that you need to get more films with the really big stars to be out there. Now, that may also be true. But I did that, but it didn't work for me. One of them had a very good role also. I am talking about Kaabil but unfortunately, that was also like ‘aapka role usme utna hi tha (you had a small role). But I could not figure out why people were thinking like that. Why aren't they thinking about how I performed in that film. We often talk about films made outside of our country where big stars do small roles in big films. Anyway, it is easy to talk about this today. But back then it sounded like you are complaining about every trivial thing. It is better to take a breather and reshuffle everything.",
